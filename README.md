# Mapping tool - City history and its urban texture

## Description
The history and relics of a city and the cultural and political influence brought by them become part of the urban texture, making each city unique. This mapping tool studied the history of the city and its connection with the modern city to observe the impact of the cultural background on citizens in modern life(recreational or educational), and analyse how does history impact on the urban planning.

This is a file based on grasshopper. It takes some urban component related to city history and common urban elements like residential buildings and parks, to discover the historical influence to urban planning by integrating the information of the chosen site and present the site analysis in a effective and clear way.
